<For Admins: Need to update KEGG?>

KEGG updates every Wednesday JST. It's best to start an update /on Tuesday or Wednesday US CST/.

If you start updating on a Saturday/Sunday/Monday, you may not finish before the next update window.

# Mirror via lftp
##########

# Use lftp to mirror (WARNING: more than 2 parallel downloads will get you throttled!)
# ** Open this in screen or tmux -- it will take 48+ hours **

mkdir raw-mirrors/latest_kegg_version
cp -pr raw-mirrors/old_version/* raw-mirrors/latest_kegg_version  (KEGG preserves times, so remember -p)
cd raw-mirrors/latest_kegg_version

lftp
set ftp:list-options -a;
open ftp://ftp.bioinformatics.jp/kegg/;
mirror --delete --no-perms --verbose --parallel=2  (optionally, set --ignore-time if you've screwed up the -p)

# If this stalls / fails, just stop and re-start the command.

# Mirror again?

If you don't see that -- or you see an error -- run the lftp mirror commands ** a second time **
(Sometimes, KEGG will be in an update cycle. Repeat until the repo is unchanged by an lftp sync.)
